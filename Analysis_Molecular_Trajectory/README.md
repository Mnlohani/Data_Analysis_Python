# Introduction and Objective:
In this work, we will analyse two saparate molecular simulation trajectories generated by two saparate methods. One is from Molecular dynamics (MD) and the other is generated from Monte Carlo simulations. 
But we do not know beforehand which is generated by which method.  We will explore each of trajectory in a detailed manner looking into 2-D and 3-D plots and making Histograms and find out the annswer.  
 
We will also implement elbow method to find out optimal clusters for the partitioning method.
We will use k-mean clustering as a partitioning method. **Please refer the analysis.pdf for analytical inferences and .ipynb for code.** 


## About the Dataset
The dataset contains two trajectory files. Each containsthe following format where x, y is position and E is corresponding potential energy of molecule at that position.
|x|y|E|
|---|---|---|
